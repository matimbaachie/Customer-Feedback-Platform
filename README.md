# Customer Feedback Platform

## Project Summary  
I developed this platform to collect, analyze, and visualize customer feedback across products and services. It provides administrators with deep insights via secure, authenticated dashboards powered by Azure AD.

The frontend, built with React, enables users to submit feedback forms while administrators can log in (via MSAL.js) to view reports. The backend in ASP.NET Core processes data and stores it in an Azure SQL Database using Entity Framework Core. The entire platform is hosted on Azure App Service.

## Key Features  
- Azure AD login for internal staff/admin dashboards  
- Feedback submission form for customers  
- Admin analytics dashboard for data visualization  
- RESTful backend APIs with role-secured endpoints  
- Azure SQL with EF Core migrations  
- Deployed using Azure App Service  

## Tech Stack  
- React, MSAL.js  
- ASP.NET Core Web API  
- Entity Framework Core, Azure SQL  
- Azure App Service, Azure AD  

## What I Delivered  
- Azure AD protected frontend and backend  
- Scalable data model for customer responses  
- Role-based reporting APIs  
- Frontend visualization using chart libraries  
- Azure deployment with staging and production slots  
- Documentation and usage reporting guides
